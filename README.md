# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous functions. The `bug.dart` file shows the initial code with inadequate error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.

## Problem

The original `fetchData` function lacks comprehensive error handling.  If the API request fails or the response is malformed, the error messages are unhelpful for debugging.  The program may even crash unexpectedly depending on the nature of the error.

## Solution

The improved `fetchData` function incorporates the following improvements:

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Catches exceptions during the API request and JSON decoding, providing context-rich error messages.
* **Status Code Checking:** Checks the HTTP status code, throwing an exception for non-200 responses.
* **Detailed Error Messages:** Includes the status code or the exception's message in the error messages to aid in debugging.
* **Rethrowing Exceptions:** After logging the error, the exception is rethrown to allow higher levels to handle the failure appropriately.

By implementing these changes, the code becomes more robust and easier to debug.
